                    <p>With a collection of over 20,000 artworks including pieces from Picasso and Monet,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan_Museum_of_Art"><strong>the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA)</strong></a> is one of the leading university art museums in US. Their mission is "to transform individual and civic life by promoting the discovery, contemplation, and enjoyment of the art of our world”</p>
                    <p class="no-top">However, with the lack of formal visitor service staff, they felt that current onsite experience isn’t leaving impressions that matches the Museum’s mission and goal.</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Navigation is a big issue to current visitors.</h3>
                    <p class="no-top no-bottom">Through affinity wall, we found out that many interviewees expressed frustration about the museum's current map and signage system.</p>
                    <blockquote><strong>"The map is crap"</strong><footer>Communication Manager</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote><strong>"One of the most common question at the store is where is the restroom"</strong><footer>Store Attendant</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote><strong>"We are trying to change the signage system, they are inconsistent throughout the museum"</strong><footer>Visitor Experience Manager</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="no-bottom">Which leads us to host observation session by inviting friends that never visited the museum to navigate it. During the session, I noticed that my friends and other visitors all had problems getting to the 2nd floor of the building and finding artworks that attracted them to visit the museum.</p>
                    <blockquote><strong>"Where can I find the Monet painting you mentioned?"</strong><footer>Friend I brought to the Museum for observation</footer>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>After analyzing the data from interviews and observation session, we found out that these are the reasons why UMMA is hard to navigate for first time visitors.</p>

                      <img src="img/creative/umma/finding2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                    </a>
                      <!-- <h3>Museum creates an estranged environment.</h3>
                      <p>Another insight that we discovered through secondary research is that museum tend to create an estranged environment, that a lot of visitors feel pressured upon. For UMMA, it is even more so.</p>
                      <a href="img/creative/umma/finding3.jpg" class="individual" title="Not a Welcoming Space">
                        <img src="img/creative/umma/finding3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                      </a>
                      <h3>Need for someone to serve at the information desk</h3>

                      <p>Throughout interviews, another consistent theme that almost every interviewee mentioned, is the need for having an information professional staffing the desk upon entrance. However, they also revealed that the reason for them to not have one right now is mainly because of these reasons:</p>
                      <ul class="listStyle">
                        <li><p>The school have limited budget allocated to them and the majority of it has been given to communication manager to redesign the signage system and promote their annual giving campaign.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The museum has too many entrances that just having one information desk will not effectively solve their problem</p></li>
                        <li><p>They have tried volunteers in the past, but most volunteers are not attentive enough to deliver good customer-service experience.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>During our observation session, 0 of 19 people approached the information kiosk, but all 19 looked at the person taking notes upon entering the museum. This resonates with our literature review in customer service practices, where in an alien environment, a human face is usually the first thing a person looks for. </p> -->

                      <h3>UMMA is not effectively communicating their offerings.</h3>
                      <p>During interviews with employees, we noticed that one major concern for UMMA is that lots of students don't even know its existence. Visitors also lack general information about the museum, such as what artwork it has, what events there are, or even the gallery hours.</p>
                      <p>The most prominent problem is that UMMA over relied on website for orienting their visitor and neglected on-site materials, even though lots of visitor don't even go to their website before visiting. For example, UMMA offers free tours on Sunday, however, the only way to know it onsite is a sign placed at the information desk only on Sunday. </p>
                      <p>Meanwhile, the website is also not executed in a visitor friendly way.</p>

                      <h3>Other Findings</h3>
                      <p>Most department lack effective way to collect visitor feedback.</p>
                      <p>Curators are unsure of the implementation in technology for UMMA.</p>
