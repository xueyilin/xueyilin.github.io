                  <p>Easi Game App is a side project for 360 PC Security's Weekly Game section which has over 600k active users and convert 100k to 360 Game Center, one of the company's most profitable product.</p>
                  <p>As more users migrate to wireless devices, the significance of PC platform is decaying. It is hard to maintain the current active users, and our team need to find new opportunity to create more value.</p>
                  <h3>Goal</h3>
                  <p class="no-top"><strong>Create a HTML 5 game platform that transform the current 600k users on PC to mobile app.</strong></p>

                    <p>For this project, I was the sole product designer on the team and <strong>was responsible for designing the app and the content management system from scratch.</strong> Since this project is treated as an internal startup project, I also served the role of product owner that thrives to pull resources to support the development and push the promotion of this platform.</p>
                    <p>I worked with an UI designer, an android developer, a game developer, and a database developer to make the app and games in it go live.</p>

                      <p class="no-top">In 2014, one HTML5 game called "Trap the Crazy Cat" has gone viral in China. By leveraging one of China's biggest social network, Wechat Moment, it has accrued 200,000,000 pageviews in merely 3 days.</p>
                      <img src="img/creative/easiplay/crazycat.png" class="img-responsive img-row">
                      <!-- <p class="cap" align="center">
                        <span class="caption text-muted"> Mechanism behind Crazy Cat's success</span>
                      </p> -->
                      <p>By conducting case study on this game, we noticed that although the game is very mundane, there seems to be a formula that works: </p>
                      <ul class="listStyle">
                        <li><p>This type of games are easy to share and play since it requires no installation</p></li>
                        <li><p>When a round of game ends, it assign scores that advocates social comparison</p></li>
                        <li><p>The game can be finished in a few minutes, thus not costing lots of productivity</p></li>
                        <li><p>There's no specific technique, which encourages people to try again and again</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>We hope that by learning from this there could be a way to make our product and go viral too. </p>

                      <h3><strong>Need Assessment: Opportunity in current market</strong></h3>
                      <p>By assessing current market environment, we also noticed that existing HTML5 games present lots of territory unexplored, despite its advantage in being able to distribute through multiple channels.</p>
                        <img src="img/creative/easiplay/market.png" class="img-responsive img-row">
                      <p>All the major competitors are taking similar approach in feature and design, with no apparent differentiation and share some common issues:</p>
                      <ul class="listStyle">
                        <li><p>Stuffing all existing games into the app.</p></li>
                        <li><p>No champion board or any user focused features.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Games themselves are low quality</p></li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3><strong>Data Analysis: Which of our current assets can be useful</strong></h3>
                      <p class="no-top">For the PC version of weekly games, our team worked with the game development team to curate one well made flash game every week. From the data gathered for the PC version, I found that the daily ranking system and the starting screen of the game have significant effects on engagement. </p>

                    <h3>Initial Design: Focus on high-quality content.</h3>
                    <p class="no-top" >When we first kick start the project, we can only get license for games we self-developed, so we worked with our company's game team to develop several games for the initial launch.</p>
                    <p class="no-bottom">Based on the data of pc version, we decided to transform some of the most well received flash games to html5 games.</p>
                    <a href="img/creative/easiplay/games.png" class="individual" title="Games interface">
                      <img src="img/creative/easiplay/games.png" class="img-responsive img-row">
                    </a>
                    <p>I started designing the app through exploring the user flow, from where it start to ending game, getting on chart and sharing with others</p>
                    <a href="img/creative/easiplay/flow.png" class="individual" title="User Flow">

                    </a>
                    <p class="no-bottom">In the first version, we also investigated on various ways to present the game list. </p>
                    <a href="img/creative/easiplay/exploration.png" class="individual" title="Homepage Exploration">
                      <img src="img/creative/easiplay/exploration.png" class="img-responsive img-row">
                    </a>
                    <p>We tried to utilize the high quality game by <strong>presenting the game to users right upon entrance.</strong>The rest of the games were present in a picture flow form to encourage engagement. Champion chart and sharing feature are placed at the top navigation bar to encourage user usage.</p>
                    <a href="img/creative/easiplay/ui1.png" class="individual" title="Interface Version 1">

                    <h3>Test Run: Some design isn't fitting user context</h3>
                    <p class="no-top no-bottom">This project was conducted under a very agile process and the first version was immediately launched after development to gather user feedback data. Through looking at the data collected we realized that: </p>
                    <ul class="listStyle">
                      <li><p>The champion chart is rarely looked at.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Share function was almost never used after gaming.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Multiple feedbacks complaining there's too few games to play with.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Iteration: Redesigning the whole structure</h3>
                    <p>After finding out that features like sharing and champion chart that we want to utilize is not properly emphasized. We started reconsidering the user flow and realized that these two features being placed at the top left corner makes it detached from the whole gaming process. So we decided to redesign the user flow to better fit user context.</p></li>

                    <h3> Key Change 1: Picture Flow to List Layout</h3>
                    <p>While doing the first version, we utilized a pinterest like layout to highlight the quality of the few games that we have available. However, as our licensed game grows, we decided to switch to version 2 to allow users to explore the amount of games we have.</p>
                    <img src="img/creative/easiplay/keychange1.png" class="img-responsive">
                    <h3> Key Change 2: Featured Games to Game List</h3>
                    <p>Through the test run, we found out that even though the weekly game was well received, it still didn’t escape the short life cycle nature. On top of that, the loading time of the featured game also result in a high bounce rate right upon entrance. Thus, we decided to get rid of the three tabs and the featured games, but just focus on games available</p>
                    <img src="img/creative/easiplay/keychange2.png" class="img-responsive">
                    <h3> Key Change 3: Focus on Game Over Screen</h3>
                    <p>Through the test run and user feedback, we realized that placing sharing and champion chart on the navbar disassociated them with the game results.So we decided to place them on the game end screen to emphasize its relation to scores</p>
